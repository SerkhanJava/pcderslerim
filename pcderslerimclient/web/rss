LYRICS
Just waking up in the morning
And to be well,
Quite honest with ya,
I ain&apos;t really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought&apos;s been derailed?
That&apos;s when you press on - Lee nails
Half the population&apos;s just waitin to see me fail
Yeah right, you&apos;re better off trying to freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retail

But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Everytime you fall it&apos;s only making your chin strong
And I&apos;ll be in your corner like mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear a song from that big lady

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya&apos;ll?

Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we&apos;re dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That&apos;s what they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me,
This one&apos;s a fighter

And if I can last thirty rounds
There&apos;s no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, loserville, nothing town

Text book version of a kid going nowhere fast
And now I&apos;m yelling &quot;kiss my ass&quot;
It&apos;s gonna take a couple right hooks, a few left jabs
For you to recognize you really ain&apos;t got it bad

Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do ya&apos;ll?

Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we&apos;re dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That&apos;s what they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me,
This one&apos;s a fighter

Everybody put yo hands up
What we gonna do ya&apos;ll?

If you fall pick yourself up off the floor (get up)
And when your bones can&apos;t take no more (c&apos;mon)
Just remember what you&apos;re here for
Cuz I know Imma damn sure

Give em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we&apos;re dead.
Give me scars, give me pain
Then they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me
There goes the fighter, there goes the fighter
Here comes the fighter
That&apos;s what they&apos;ll say of me, say of me, say of me,
This one&apos;s a fighter

&apos;Til the referee rings the bell
&apos;Til both ya eyes start to swell
&apos;Til the crowd goes home,
What we gonna do kid?</description>

Lyrics:
Baby I&apos;m preying on you tonight
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals
Animals
Like animals

Maybe you think that you can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals
Animals
Like animals
Baby I&apos;m 

So what you trying to do to me
It&apos;s like we can&apos;t stop we&apos;re enemies
But we get along when I&apos;m inside you
You&apos;re like a drug that&apos;s killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I&apos;m inside you 

Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it&apos;s meant to be
But you can&apos;t stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground 
You can pretend that it was me
But no

Baby I&apos;m preying on you tonight
Hunt you down eat you alive
Just like animals
Animals
Like animals

Maybe you think that you can hide

So if I run it&apos;s not enough
You&apos;re still in my head forever stuck
So you can do what you wanna do
I love your lies I&apos;ll eat &apos;em up
But don&apos;t deny the animal
That comes alive when I&apos;m inside you

Yeah you can start over you can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it&apos;s meant to be
But you can&apos;t stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down rolling on the ground 
You can pretend that it was me
But no

<title>Minions - Official Trailer (HD) - Illumination</title>
<link>http://gempixel.com/media/view/minions-official-trailer-hd-illumination</link>
<description>Meet Stuart, Kevin and Bob as they embark on a journey for their new master in the Official Trailer for Minions. In Theaters July 10, 2015

SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/IlluminationSub

About Minions:
The story of Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment’s Minions begins at the dawn of time. Starting as single-celled yellow organisms, Minions evolve through the ages, perpetually serving the most despicable of masters.  After accidentally killing off so many of them—from T. rex to Napoleon—the Minions find themselves without a master to serve and fall into a deep depression. 
 
But one Minion named Kevin has a plan, and he—alongside teenage rebel Stuart and lovable little Bob—ventures out into the world to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. 
 
The trio embarks upon an adventure that ultimately leads them to their next potential master, Scarlet Overkill (Academy Award® winner Sandra Bullock), the world’s first-ever female super-villain.  They travel from frigid Antarctica to 1960s New York City, ending in mod London, where they must face their biggest challenge to date: saving all of Minionkind...from annihilation. 
 
Featuring a soundtrack of hit music from the ’60s that still permeates our culture today, Minions is produced by Illumination’s Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy, and is directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda.  Brian Lynch has written the screenplay for the 3D-CG comedy adventure, and Chris Renaud serves as executive producer of the film. 

In Theaters - July 10, 2015

Cast: Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm
